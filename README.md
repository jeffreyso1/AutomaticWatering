### What
This project attempts to track moisture level in the soil using a moisture sensor. 
And water plant when moisture level is lower than a threshold.

### Why
Different plant have different watering needs.
This project allows me to water multiple house plants at home in a more effective and efficient way.

# Technology
### Hardware
- Arduino C
- Capacitative Soil Moisture Sensor
- ESP32
- Water Pump

# Future Enhancement
- A backend to track moisture and watering history
